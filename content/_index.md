We are going to deploy BOSH environment in AWS. We will install BOSH Director using the BOSH CLI. Once the Director is running we will use the BOSH CLI to deploy Nginx to the environment and upgrade/scale it.

Note
This will be a highly interactive workshop! Please be sure you have your AWS Credentials ready!
